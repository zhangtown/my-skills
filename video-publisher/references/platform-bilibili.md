# Bilibili Adapter Contract

Read `platform-common.md` and `ego-browser-workflow.md` first.

## Draft Resolution

Bilibili is the only platform with a tested automatic quarantine path.

Treat `本地浏览器存在…未提交的视频 / 继续编辑` as unresolved identity:

1. Click `继续编辑`.
2. If the resumed filename or expected title matches the package, reuse the target.
3. If another video owns the editor, click `存草稿`.
4. Return to the upload URL and verify that the page is clean before uploading the target.

The detector must distinguish:

```text
anyUploaded: a completed video exists
targetUploaded: the requested filename/title owns that completed video
```

Do not equate “target not found” with “no active upload”. This false equivalence previously skipped foreign-draft quarantine.

Both same-target resume and a real foreign-draft save/clean-page flow passed live testing. A later task-space-loss test recreated the Bilibili space, resumed the same target with no video upload, and repaired only the page state that did not survive the restore.

A separate 533 MB fault test terminated the orchestrator while Bilibili was actively uploading. The same task space resumed with upload action mode `resume_existing`, completed without another file injection, and independently reached `READY`.

## Upload Entry Recovery

The current task-space tab may remain on another authenticated `member.bilibili.com` page that has no upload input. Treat this as a bounded page-readiness state, not immediate selector drift:

1. Wait for the target, an active upload, a restore banner, or the real upload input.
2. After six failed probes, navigate to the exact maintained upload URL once, only when no uploaded draft owns the page.
3. Re-arm the final-publish guard because full navigation replaces the guarded document.
4. Activate and focus the new page lifecycle before accepting its input.
5. Scope the file input to `.bcc-upload-wrapper`; ignore detached 1×1 video inputs elsewhere in the document.
6. Require upload progress or completed target evidence within 20 seconds after injection.

This flow was reproduced from the authenticated creator home page with zero video inputs. A hidden navigated page accepted a 93 MB file into `input.files` but did not start the upload component. The same clean page started immediately after lifecycle activation and reached `上传完成`. A later full recovery run recorded one navigation, reused the matching restored target without reinjection, and preserved the armed final-publish guard.

## Metadata And Declarations

Set and independently verify:

```text
exact title
exact description
内容无需标注
内容为自制：未经作者允许，禁止转载
```

Bilibili may show the self-made value in the input while keeping `内容无需标注` in selected component state. Require both observations.

Preserve the current relevant partition unless a confirmed package requires another one. The current production ready model does not claim that it automatically chooses a partition.

## Tags

Read chips directly from `.label-item-v2-container`, not a broad body-text segment.

Remove unexpected tags through the chip component’s real close behavior. Keep only requested tags plus any exact automatic tags supplied by `bilibiliAllowedAutoTags`. The default allowlist is empty; do not embed content-category defaults in the adapter.

```text
"bilibiliAllowedAutoTags": []
```

Remove unexpected chips one at a time and wait for Vue state to settle after each close. Closing several chips synchronously from one stale DOM snapshot causes only the last batched removal to persist; this was reproduced with the automatic `学习`, `课程`, and `经验分享` chips.

Add missing tags one at a time using real focus, CDP text insertion, and real Enter. Wait for platform validation and a visible chip before continuing.

Critical rule: if the tag input is already empty, do not press Backspace; Bilibili interprets it as deleting the last committed chip.

The final tag set must contain every requested chip, no duplicate/malformed chip, and no unapproved extra chip.

If Bilibili reports that a requested tag is topic-only and cannot be added as a custom tag, preserve a typed metadata blocker. Continue independent cover repair so one rejected tag does not leave the rest of the draft unfinished. Do not silently drop or replace the requested tag.

## Custom Cover

Use the user-provided `4:3` asset only when enabled.

Upload through the active `.bcc-upload-wrapper` image input. The cover editor’s final control can be a `div.button.submit`, not a native button. Wait until its exact label becomes `完成`, click it through the real input channel, and require the editor to close.

On the currently tested editor, a correctly targeted real selector click may still be swallowed by the framework or time out at the CDP input boundary. First attempt the real click. If it times out, or the same visible `封面制作` dialog and the same enabled `.button.submit` control remain after the settle window, the adapter may invoke that exact scoped control through the page framework once. Record `frameworkFallbackUsed`, then still require the dialog to close and the accepted main-page cover URL to appear. Never broaden this fallback to text search or to any final-publish control.

Read the accepted main cover from `.cover .cover-content .cover-img`. Persist its `archive.biliimg.com` or `biliimg.com` URL as the receipt. The same content-addressed URL may remain when re-uploading the identical file, so proof requires the upload action, enabled completion control, closed editor, and accepted main-page URL together.

A matching checkpoint is only expected identity evidence. If a restored same-target editor does not expose the checkpoint URL on the live main cover, do not mark the cover ready. Re-upload the exact asset, record the new action receipt, and independently verify the main card even when the content-addressed CDN URL is unchanged.

## Required Gates

```text
authenticated
correct target or clean quarantined state
video fully uploaded
exact title and description
exact requested tag chips plus only allowed auto-tags
both declaration states
custom 4:3 receipt when enabled
no blocking dialog
visible enabled 立即投稿 button
final publish not clicked
```

The complete draft path passed real testing on 2026-07-14, including foreign-draft quarantine, the scoped cover-completion fallback, checkpoint recovery, and repeated no-op verification.
