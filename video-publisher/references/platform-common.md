# Platform Common Contract

Read this file and the exact platform reference before changing a live adapter.

## Ownership And Safety

One orchestrator owns all platform task spaces. Do not use sub Agents for live creator-page control.

Before reading or writing job state or starting a platform phase, acquire the state-root `.publisher/orchestrator.lock` and then the job-directory `orchestrator.lock`. The state-root lock allows only one video job to control the shared creator accounts; the job lock additionally protects one persisted job. A second process must fail immediately instead of splitting platform locks with the owner. Remove both locks on every normal exit; after a crash, remove a lock only when its recorded PID is no longer alive. A fresh lock whose owner file is still being written remains busy.

Never click a final `发布`, `发布笔记`, `发表`, or `立即投稿` button without explicit authorization in the current run. Every adapter result must leave `finalPublishClicked: false`. The shared core installs a capture-phase click/submit guard; safety passes only when `guardArmed: true` and `blockedAttempts: 0` are observed from the live page.

If Ego reports that the user controls a task space, stop the whole browser job. Do not retry, create a replacement task space, or claim it without explicit user confirmation.

## Production Sequence

Use `scripts/run-safe-platforms.sh`, which invokes `scripts/v2/publisher.mjs`.

```text
1. inspect all selected platforms in parallel
2. resolve Bilibili restore/foreign-draft state through the serial UI queue
3. upload missing videos in parallel
4. wait for every upload runner to exit
5. mutate metadata, entities, declarations, settings, and covers serially
6. verify platforms independently in parallel
```

Do not pipeline UI mutations behind unfinished uploads. Live testing showed that overlapping upload processes and UI control can freeze the shared Ego input channel even across isolated task spaces.

The browser channel is shared across task spaces. If any runner reports `INPUT_CHANNEL_BROKEN`, treat it as a phase-wide circuit breaker: wait for all already-started parallel runners, skip every remaining quarantine/upload/mutate action, and run only final read-only verification. An ordinary same-job retry after Ego restarts is the recovery path.

Before step 1, validate the exact local media for every selected platform. The shared media preflight checks file existence and reads MP4/M4V/MOV duration from ISO BMFF metadata without an external `ffprobe` dependency. Douyin permits only 0.1 seconds of container rounding above its real-tested 900-second content limit; anything longer must be excluded before browser work and recorded as `PLATFORM_REJECTED_ASSET`. Other valid selected platforms continue through the same run. If no selected platform is eligible, fail before job creation. Never silently trim, transcode, or substitute another source.

The maintained adapter runner also takes an atomic per-platform filesystem lock. A second process targeting the same platform fails before opening Ego instead of overlapping with an active upload, mutation, inspection, or verification. Stale locks from dead processes are removed automatically. This still permits the intended four-platform parallel upload/check phases.

The three lock levels solve different races: the state-root publisher lock serializes video jobs that share creator accounts, the job lock protects one persisted job, and platform locks prevent accidental same-platform overlap as defense in depth. Four-platform upload/check parallelism remains available inside the one owning video job.

Persist the exact task-space name alongside its numeric id. After an Ego crash, ids may be recycled for a different job; a live name mismatch is identity loss, never permission to enter that space. Select or recreate only the stored exact name, invalidate old-space receipts, and verify fresh page truth.

## Platform Phases

```text
inspect: read-only page observation
quarantine: Bilibili-only draft resolution
upload: target video upload and full completion wait
mutate: idempotent UI repair
verify: fresh independent observation using stored receipts
```

Removed legacy modes must not reappear: `fill`, `check-only`, `repair-only`, `upload-only`, and `quarantine-only`.

## Upload Truth

File injection is never success by itself. Treat an upload as complete only when platform-specific completion evidence is visible and no progress/failure signal remains.

Strong incomplete signals include:

```text
uploading / processing text
percentage progress
取消上传
转码中
上传失败 or network/file-format errors
```

Preview cards may appear before completion. WeChat Channels was observed showing cover cards at 50%; that state is still uploading.

WeChat Channels may also be logically focused but browser-lifecycle hidden. Its adapter must reactivate the page lifecycle while waiting so upload progress and dialog transitions can advance.

Every upload adapter must be idempotent:

- reuse a confirmed target draft;
- wait when that target is already uploading;
- do not inject the same file again merely because metadata is incomplete;
- block or quarantine when another draft owns the editor.

Every upload observation records one of these action modes:

```text
already_ready: the target was complete before the upload phase
resume_existing: the target was already uploading, so the adapter only waited
injected: this runner injected the verified local file
```

On process restart, `resume_existing` is the required evidence that an active browser upload was not reinjected. If that resumed upload later shows an explicit platform failure, end the wait with the typed platform failure; a later bounded retry may use `injected` only after the active upload has ended.

## Draft Identity

Use filename first when the platform exposes it, then confirmed title/description evidence as a fallback.

Bilibili must track both:

```text
anyUploaded: some completed video exists in the editor
targetUploaded: that completed video matches the requested filename/title
```

If `anyUploaded` is true and `targetUploaded` is false, the editor is foreign even though the target video gate is false.

WeChat Channels does not expose the filename. Reuse an uploaded draft only when the description is empty or matches the package; a different non-empty description is foreign.

## Central Ready Model

Platform adapters return observations and receipts, never `ready`. `scripts/v2/lib/model.mjs` computes readiness from required gates.

Shared gates:

```text
authenticated
draftIdentity
video
platform metadata and tag/entity gates
required declarations/settings
cover
noBlockingDialog
finalButton
safety
```

A mutation result is not enough. The final `verify` phase must re-read the page and match stored cover receipts.

The production runner also writes accepted cover receipts to an atomic per-job, per-platform schema-`2` checkpoint. Each checkpoint is bound to its platform, package fingerprint, and numeric task-space id. On restart, the orchestrator loads only exact matches, then performs the same fresh page verification. If Ego explicitly recreates a task space, clear both state receipts and the checkpoint even when the replacement recycles the same numeric id. Checkpoints are recovery evidence, not a substitute for `verify`.

Every completed state save keeps the prior valid `state.json` as an atomic one-generation backup. If the primary file is invalid JSON, restore only when the backup fingerprint matches the current package, preserve the corrupt primary with a timestamped filename, and re-run normal inspect/verify. If the backup is missing, invalid, or belongs to another fingerprint, fail closed before browser work.

## Cover Receipts

When custom covers are enabled, persist a receipt containing:

```text
assetPath
ratio
before URL(s)
accepted main-page URL
```

The verifier must find the accepted URL in the platform’s main cover card or preview. A successful `uploadFile` call, a modal canvas, or a temporary mirrored preview is insufficient.

For WeChat Channels, only the main `.vertical-cover-wrap img.vertical-img-size` and `.horizon-cover-wrap img.horizon-img-size` card URLs count. Avatars, video-frame URLs elsewhere on the page, data-URL crop previews, and phone-preview mirrors are not receipts.

Douyin requires separate portrait and landscape receipts with distinct accepted card URLs.

If the page already contains two distinct Douyin custom covers but neither job state nor a matching checkpoint contains receipts, do not infer that the images are the requested assets and do not blindly re-upload them. Return a typed ambiguous-state blocker.

## Typed Blockers

Use stable blocker codes from `scripts/v2/lib/model.mjs`, including:

```text
AUTH_REQUIRED
USER_CONTROL
FOREIGN_DRAFT
UPLOAD_NOT_STARTED
UPLOAD_STALLED
RISK_CONTROL
SELECTOR_DRIFT
STATE_AMBIGUOUS
INPUT_CHANNEL_BROKEN
PLATFORM_REJECTED_ASSET
ACTION_FAILED
```

Do not hide a typed blocker behind a generic “not ready” message. Only authentication and explicit user control require the user immediately; Bilibili foreign drafts route to quarantine.

## Platform Text And Tags

```text
Xiaohongshu: selected topic entities; no prose body by default.
Douyin: exact package-supplied topics as real entities, with no residue or duplicates.
Bilibili: exact requested tag chips; allow only relevant platform auto-tags declared by the adapter.
WeChat Channels: plain hashtags inside the description; short title empty by default.
```

Never fake topic/entity HTML. Use the visible editor, real suggestion row, and a fresh entity check.

## Acceptance

Unit tests may prove scheduler barriers, persistence, and gate evaluation. Only a real creator-page run can accept selectors, topic entities, declaration dialogs, settings, draft quarantine, and cover flows.

On 2026-07-14, the production scheduler passed a real four-platform run with four parallel uploads, serialized mutation, persisted task-space/cover state, interruption recovery, and four parallel fresh verifiers all `READY` before the final publish controls.

On 2026-07-15, a later regression terminated the orchestrator during serialized Douyin topic insertion after every video upload had completed. Recovery found the exact title/body and two of five real topic entities, performed no video upload, safely rebuilt the partial rich editor, completed the remaining platforms, and reached four-platform `READY` plus three no-op reruns.

Another 2026-07-15 regression proved that per-job locks were insufficient for two different jobs: simultaneous runs split platform ownership and one state was left `running`. The state-root publisher lock now rejects one contender before state/browser work while preserving the owner's four-platform parallel phases. The refused real job's prior `READY` state remained byte-identical, and both normal release and dead-PID global-lock recovery passed live testing.

A real process-group `SIGKILL` during four parallel uploads subsequently left all three lock levels plus job state behind. The ordinary same-job retry removed only locks whose PIDs were dead, reused all four numeric task spaces, and received `resume_existing` from every upload adapter. It completed all custom-cover and metadata gates, reached four-platform `READY`, and stayed no-op `READY` for three reruns.

A later Ego Lite process-group crash proved a separate failure boundary. A missing structured browser result is now converted into retryable `INPUT_CHANNEL_BROKEN` evidence with every required gate false, never into upload work or a fatal parse exception. After restart, the explicit task-space recreation signal invalidates stale receipts independently of numeric-id equality. The real recovery rebuilt only lost browser state, reached four-platform `READY`, and passed three further no-op reruns with every final guard armed and zero attempts.

A second real Ego crash during active uploads proved that the broken input channel must stop all later UI work for the entire invocation. The patched orchestrator emitted no mutation phase. On restart, numeric ids recycled into another ready job; exact stable-name matching rejected those collisions. The intended four-platform job recovered to `READY`, and three no-op reruns contained only inspect and verify phases.

A subsequent cold-start run with exact paths containing a space before their suffixes completed four parallel uploads and all custom-cover receipts. It exposed and repaired Douyin's first-topic shared-text-node shape, then reached four-platform `READY` and passed three inspect/verify-only reruns.

A real mutation-stage crash then killed Ego one second after the Douyin mutator started. Douyin returned `INPUT_CHANNEL_BROKEN`; the two platforms still queued behind it recorded no mutation phase. Ordinary recovery rebuilt the lost pages and returned four-platform `READY`, followed by three inspect/verify-only reruns. This proves the phase-wide circuit breaker applies during serial mutation, not only parallel uploads.
