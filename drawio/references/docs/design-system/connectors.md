# Connectors

## Infrastructure Routing Rules

- Use solid bound edges for the main flow; use dashed edges only for auxiliary, asynchronous, or non-primary relationships, and explain the distinction in a legend when both appear.
- Connect a cluster or container at its boundary when representing collective traffic. Do not draw one long external edge to every replica inside it.
- Keep routes short and local. When no collinear route exists, use an explicit waypoint around the obstacle rather than a long decorative detour.

The Design System defines a semantic connector system with clear visual hierarchy for different relationship types.

## Connector Types

### Primary Flow

**Purpose**: Main process flow, critical paths

| Property | Value                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Line     | Solid, 2px                          |
| Arrow    | Open (`endArrow=open`)              |
| Color    | Text color (`#1E293B` in Tech Blue) |

```yaml
edges:
  - from: a
    to: b
    type: primary
```

```xml
<mxCell style="endArrow=open;endSize=12;strokeWidth=2;
  strokeColor=#1E293B;" />
```

---

### Data Flow

**Purpose**: Data transmission, async communication, API calls

| Property | Value             |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| Line     | Dashed (6 4), 2px |
| Arrow    | Open              |
| Color    | Text color        |

```yaml
edges:
  - from: service
    to: database
    type: data
    label: Query
```

```xml
<mxCell style="endArrow=open;endSize=12;strokeWidth=2;
  dashed=1;dashPattern=6 4;strokeColor=#1E293B;" />
```

---

### Optional

**Purpose**: Weak relationships, optional paths, fallbacks

| Property | Value                  |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| Line     | Dotted (2 2), 1px      |
| Arrow    | Open block             |
| Color    | Muted text (`#64748B`) |

```yaml
edges:
  - from: main
    to: fallback
    type: optional
```

```xml
<mxCell style="endArrow=open;endFill=0;strokeWidth=1;
  dashed=1;dashPattern=2 2;strokeColor=#64748B;" />
```

---

### Dependency

**Purpose**: Dependencies, constraints, composition

| Property | Value          |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Line     | Solid, 1px     |
| Arrow    | Filled diamond |
| Color    | Text color     |

```yaml
edges:
  - from: component
    to: library
    type: dependency
```

```xml
<mxCell style="endArrow=diamond;endFill=1;strokeWidth=1;
  strokeColor=#1E293B;" />
```

---

### Bidirectional

**Purpose**: Associations, mutual relationships, two-way communication

| Property | Value            |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| Line     | Solid, 1.5px     |
| Arrow    | None (both ends) |
| Color    | Muted text       |

```yaml
edges:
  - from: serviceA
    to: serviceB
    type: bidirectional
```

```xml
<mxCell style="endArrow=none;startArrow=none;strokeWidth=1.5;
  strokeColor=#64748B;" />
```

## Agentic / LLM Flow Semantics

For LLM-agent and RAG diagrams, these typed connectors carry flow meaning. The color/dash
values below are the **default (Tech Blue / light) defaults only**. Inside a theme, the
theme's own connector palette overrides them — arch-dark and academic remap these to their
own tokens (see Theme Variations). Precedence is always: **explicit edge `style` > theme
token > type default**.

| Type           | Meaning                    | Default Line               | Default Color      |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `control`      | Trigger / control signal   | Solid, 1.5px, open         | `#EA580C` (orange) |
| `memory_read`  | Read from store / memory   | Solid, 1.5px, open         | `#059669` (green)  |
| `memory_write` | Write to store / memory    | Dashed (5 3), 1.5px, open  | `#059669` (green)  |
| `async`        | Async / non-blocking event | Dashed (4 2), 1.5px, open  | `#6B7280` (gray)   |
| `feedback`     | Iterative feedback loop    | Solid, 1.5px, open         | `#7C3AED` (violet) |

`primary` remains the main data path, `data` a secondary/dashed data path. Read vs. write to
the same store share a hue and differ by dash (write = dashed). All flow connectors now default to an open (`endArrow=open`) head; filled `block`/`diamond`
heads are reserved for explicit emphasis and UML/ER semantics.

```yaml
edges:
  - from: agent
    to: memory
    type: memory_write
    label: persist
```

### Legend requirement

When a diagram uses **two or more arrow semantics** (any mix of the typed connectors above,
or icons), it **must** include a legend via `meta.legend`. Use the compact single text-node
form — one multi-line text box mapping each line style/color to its meaning — matching the
academic overlay's compact-legend convention (see academic-figure-playbook). Under the
`academic-paper` profile the validator enforces this — it warns when `meta.legend` is absent
while icons or multiple connector types are present; for other profiles treat it as a
required authoring convention.

## Arrow Types

| Type           | Style | mxCell Value                     | Usage              |
| -------------- | ----- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Filled Block   | ▶     | `endArrow=block;endFill=1`       | Explicit emphasis  |
| Open (V)       | ▷     | `endArrow=open;endFill=0`        | Default flow head  |
| Filled Diamond | ◆     | `endArrow=diamond;endFill=1`     | Composition        |
| Open Diamond   | ◇     | `endArrow=diamondThin;endFill=0` | Aggregation        |
| Classic        | →     | `endArrow=classic`               | Simple arrow       |
| None           | —     | `endArrow=none`                  | Bidirectional      |

> **Format note**: In draw.io XML style strings, boolean-like values use `1`/`0` (e.g., `endFill=1`), while theme JSON definitions use `true`/`false` (e.g., `"endFill": true`). The converter handles this translation automatically.

## Routing Modes

The system selects routing algorithm based on diagram type:

### Orthogonal (Default)

Right-angle turns for technical diagrams.

```yaml
meta:
  routing: orthogonal
```

```xml
<mxCell style="edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;rounded=0;
  jumpStyle=arc;jumpSize=8;" />
```

Features:

- Horizontal/vertical segments only
- Line jumps enabled for crossings
- Clean, professional appearance

---

### Rounded

Right-angle with rounded corners for flowcharts.

```yaml
meta:
  routing: rounded
```

```xml
<mxCell style="edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;rounded=1;
  arcSize=8;" />
```

Features:

- Softer visual feel
- 8px corner radius
- Good for process flows

---

### Curved (Planned)

> **Note:** `curved` routing is not yet supported by the validator (`meta.routing` accepts `orthogonal` and `rounded` only). The draw.io XML style below works when hand-editing, but the CLI/DSL pipeline does not generate it automatically.

Bezier curves for mind maps and organic layouts.

```yaml
# Not yet supported in meta.routing — use rounded as the closest alternative
meta:
  routing: rounded
```

```xml
<!-- Manual XML only -->
<mxCell style="edgeStyle=entityRelationEdgeStyle;curved=1;" />
```

Features:

- Natural, flowing lines
- Avoid sharp turns
- Good for concept maps

---

## Line Jumps

When connectors cross, jumps prevent ambiguity:

```xml
<mxCell style="jumpStyle=arc;jumpSize=8;" />
```

| Style   | Appearance              |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| `arc`   | Small arc over crossing |
| `gap`   | Gap in line             |
| `sharp` | Sharp angle             |
| `none`  | No jump (lines cross)   |

---

## Edge Labels

### Placement

```yaml
edges:
  - from: a
    to: b
    label: "Request"
    labelPosition: center # center, start, end
```

### Styling

Labels use the theme's edge label settings:

- Font size: 10-11px
- Font weight: 400
- Color: Muted text

```xml
<mxCell style="edgeLabel;html=1;align=center;verticalAlign=middle;
  fontSize=11;fontColor=#64748B;" />
```

---

## Theme Variations

### Tech Blue

| Type          | Stroke Color       |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| primary       | `#1E293B`          |
| data          | `#1E293B`          |
| optional      | `#64748B`          |
| dependency    | `#1E293B`          |
| bidirectional | `#64748B`          |
| control       | `#EA580C`          |
| memory_read   | `#059669`          |
| memory_write  | `#059669` (dashed) |
| async         | `#6B7280`          |
| feedback      | `#7C3AED`          |

### Academic

All connectors use grayscale (`#1E1E1E` / `#4B4B4B` / `#6B6B6B`) for print compatibility.
The agentic semantics (`control`, `memory_read`/`memory_write`, `async`, `feedback`) are
distinguished by dash pattern and arrow head rather than color, since the academic palette
carries no hue.

### Dark Mode

| Type          | Stroke Color |
| ------------- | ------------ |
| primary       | `#F1F5F9`    |
| data          | `#94A3B8`    |
| optional      | `#64748B`    |
| dependency    | `#94A3B8`    |
| bidirectional | `#64748B`    |

## Best Practices

### Visual Hierarchy

1. Use **primary** for main process flow (thickest)
2. Use **data** for data transmission (dashed)
3. Use **optional** for fallback paths (thin, dotted)
4. Use **dependency** sparingly for technical relationships

### Avoid Clutter

- Limit crossings; use jumps when unavoidable
- Group related connections
- Keep connector count below 30 per diagram

### Consistency

- Use same connector type for same relationship across diagram
- Don't mix routing styles within a diagram
- Match label style to connector importance

---

## Custom Connectors

For relationships not covered by built-in types:

```yaml
edges:
  - from: a
    to: b
    style:
      strokeColor: "#DC2626"
      strokeWidth: 3
      dashed: true
      dashPattern: "8 4 2 4"
      endArrow: classic
```

Available arrow types:

- `block`, `open`, `classic`, `oval`
- `diamond`, `diamondThin`
- `ERone`, `ERmany`, `ERoneToMany`
- `none`
